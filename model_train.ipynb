He’ll take a memory or a private joke, and he’ll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes ‘bear man’. Wreaks havoc on the office. It’s really good.  \n","data.line[j]:   Okay.  \n","data.line[j]:   Pam, no, no. Holly’s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it’s a burning cross. No, no.

Andy’s mom.\n","data.line[j]:   Mmhmm.\n","data.line[j]:   You’re kidding me. Ahh!\n","data.line[j]:   That is a really good point.

Welcome.\n","data.line[j]:   Why would someone hug you?\n","data.line[j]:   Nobody hug me, I’m covered in tree sap, so…\n","data.line[j]:   Hey.\n","data.line[j]:   It’s a sophisticated take.\n","data.line[j]:   Are you serious?\n","data.line[j]:   Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I’m Santa Claus. Welcome.\n","data.line[j]:   Why would someone hug you?\n","data.line[j]:   Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date.

And we all got misled.\n","data.line[j]:   No, he doesn’t.  I told her Santa would be here.\n","data.line[j]:   I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don’t. And that’s just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.   \n","data.line[j]:   I can’t reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.   \n","data.line[j]:   What?\n","data.line[j]:   You know what’s crazy?\n","data.line[j]:   What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window?

But it also would have been incredibly tragic.\n","data.line[j]:   You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.\n","data.line[j]:   Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.  \n","data.line[j]:   Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car… for screwing Americans.\n","data.line[j]:   All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story.

So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, “Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.”\n","data.line[j]:   I find that unlikely.

Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.   \n","data.line[j]:   That’s actually “Master of Ceremonies” Bernard.   \n","data.line[j]:   Nein! I’m greek!

My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character “Mikanos”, is just a little added flava. “Mikanos” is loosely based on another character I do, “Spiros”, who is more about the ladies.   \n","data.line[j]:   Okay.   \n","data.line[j]:   Ooh. Wait, Michael?\n","data.line[j]:   Nein! I’m greek! My name is Mikanos. \n","data.line[j]:   You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today?
